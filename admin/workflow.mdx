title: Day-to-day admin workflow
description: Standard workflows and daily operations for managing OOOC Fête Finder as an administrator
---

The admin console is split into focused modules for efficient event management. This guide covers the standard workflows you'll use daily.

## Admin areas

The admin panel provides five main areas accessible at `/admin`:

- **Overview** (`/admin`) - Quick launch dashboard and system status
- **Operations** (`/admin/operations`) - Runtime status, data store controls, session management, and recovery
- **Content** (`/admin/content`) - Event sheet editor, submission moderation, and banner settings
- **Placements** (`/admin/placements`) - Paid orders queue and spotlight/promoted scheduling
- **Insights** (`/admin/insights`) - Engagement analytics and audience exports

## Standard publish flow

This is your primary workflow for updating live events.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Content area">
    Navigate to `/admin/content` to access the Event Sheet Editor
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update events">
    Edit event data in the spreadsheet interface. Changes autosave to Postgres every 850ms
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review submissions (if needed)">
    Check the Event Submissions section for new community-submitted events awaiting moderation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update banner (optional)">
    Modify the sliding banner settings if you need to highlight announcements
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a safety snapshot">
    Switch to `/admin/operations` and create a backup using **Backup Now** in Event Store Controls
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Publish changes">
    Click **Save and Revalidate Homepage** to push your changes live
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify deployment">
    Check the Live Runtime Snapshot to confirm your changes are reflected on the live site
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The Event Sheet Editor autosaves changes to Postgres, but homepage revalidation only happens when you click **Save and Revalidate Homepage**. This separation prevents accidental publishes.
</Note>

## Placements flow

Manage paid promotions and spotlight features for partner events.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Placements">
    Navigate to `/admin/placements` to access the placement scheduler
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review paid orders">
    Check the Paid Orders Queue for new partner promotion requests
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fulfill orders">
    Use the Spotlight & Promoted Scheduler to assign events to paid placement slots
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm scheduling">
    Verify queue status and timing in the scheduler timeline
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share partner stats (optional)">
    Generate and share engagement stats links with partners when needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Spotlight placements have a concurrent slot limit (default: 3 events), while Promoted placements support unlimited concurrent listings.
</Info>

## Insights flow

Track event engagement and export audience segments.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Insights dashboard">
    Navigate to `/admin/insights` to view analytics
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review engagement metrics">
    Use Event Engagement Stats to inspect:
    - Views (`click` events)
    - Outbound clicks (`outbound_click` to event URLs)
    - Calendar saves (`calendar_sync` interactions)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Analyze discovery patterns">
    Review top events, discovery metrics, and conversion rates
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Export segments">
    Download audience CSV segments filtered by genre preferences, search behavior, or filter usage
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
"Saved this" in the admin interface refers to calendar sync interactions tracked as aggregate engagement signals, not a user-visible personal saved events list.
</Warning>

## Rollback flow

Revert to a previous version if something goes wrong.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Operations">
    Navigate to `/admin/operations` immediately
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select backup">
    Choose **Latest Backup** or a specific snapshot from Recent Backups
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restore data">
    Click the restore button to revert the event data store
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Revalidate">
    Run **Save and Revalidate Homepage** to push the restored data live
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm restoration">
    Check the Live Runtime Snapshot to verify the rollback succeeded
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Health checks

Use these endpoints to verify system status:

```bash
GET /api/admin/health
GET /api/admin/data-store/status
GET /api/admin/postgres/kv
GET /api/admin/tokens/sessions
```

These endpoints provide real-time status for:
- Admin service health
- Data store connectivity
- Postgres key-value store
- Active admin sessions

## Common issues

### Save succeeds but site looks stale

Run **Save and Revalidate Homepage** again and verify the runtime source shows your latest changes.

### Spotlight/promoted schedule not applying

Verify event keys match exactly in both the Event Sheet Editor and the placement queue. Check queue status in the Placements area.

### Analytics panel empty

Confirm Postgres connectivity in Operations and verify track routes are reachable from the client.

### Submission endpoint closed

Check Event Submissions settings in the Content area. Toggle the submission endpoint status if needed.

## Best practices

- **Always create backups** before major content updates
- **Test placements** in upcoming slots before activating now
- **Review spam signals** on submissions before accepting
- **Export segments regularly** to track audience growth
- **Monitor conversion rates** to optimize event selection and placement timing
