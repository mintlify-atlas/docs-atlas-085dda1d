---

The Event Sheet Editor is a spreadsheet-style interface for managing all events on OOOC Fête Finder. It supports dynamic custom columns, real-time autosave, and full undo/redo history.

## Event Sheet Editor overview

The Event Sheet Editor stores all event data in Postgres and provides:

- Dynamic custom columns for extensibility
- 850ms autosave to prevent data loss
- Undo/redo with 120-step history
- Frozen columns for easier navigation
- Search and filter across all fields
- Read-only system columns

## Core columns

These columns are required and cannot be removed:

| Column | Description | Required |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Event Key | System-managed stable identifier for share links | Yes (read-only) |
| Title | Event name | Yes |
| Date | Event date | Yes |
| Start Time | Event start time | Yes |
| Location | Venue or location name | Yes |
| District/Area | Arrondissement or neighborhood | Yes |
| Genre | Music genre category | No |
| Price | Event pricing information | No |
| Age | Age restrictions or recommendations | No |
| Host Country | Hosting country (FR, UK, CA, NL) | No |
| Audience Country | Target audience country | No |

<Note>
**Event Key** is automatically generated from canonical identity fields (Title, Date, Start Time, Location, District/Area) when missing. This ensures stable share URLs.
</Note>

## Adding and managing rows

### Add a new event

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add row">
    Click the **Add row** button below the search controls
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fill required fields">
    Enter values for Title, Date, Start Time, Location, and District/Area at minimum
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add optional data">
    Fill in Genre, Price, Age, and other custom columns as needed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and publish">
    Changes autosave to Postgres. Click **Save and Revalidate Homepage** to publish
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Delete a row

Click the **Delete** button in the Action column for any row. Confirm the deletion prompt. The row will be removed on next save.

<Warning>
Deleting an event removes it permanently from the event sheet and all placements. Create a backup before bulk deletions.
</Warning>

## Custom columns

Add custom columns to track additional event metadata.

### Create a custom column

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter column label">
    Type a descriptive label in the "New column label" field (e.g., "Promoter", "Capacity")
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Add column">
    The column is immediately added to the sheet with a unique key
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fill values">
    Enter values for the new column across your event rows
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Rename a column

Click the column header input field, edit the label, and press Enter or click away to save.

### Reorder columns

Use the **←** and **→** buttons in column headers to move columns left or right.

### Delete a custom column

Click **Remove** in the column header. This removes the column and all its values permanently.

<Info>
Core columns cannot be renamed or deleted. Only custom columns support these operations.
</Info>

## Search and filtering

Use the search box to filter rows by any field value:

```text
Search rows: techno
```

The search is case-insensitive and matches partial strings across all columns. The counter shows filtered vs. total rows:

```text
Showing 12 of 12 filtered rows (156 total)
```

## Frozen columns

Freeze up to 4 columns to keep them visible while scrolling horizontally:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the + button">
    Click **+** to increase frozen column count
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use the - button">
    Click **-** to decrease frozen column count
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Unfreeze">
    Reset to zero frozen columns
  </Step>
</Steps>

Frozen columns remain sticky on the left with a subtle shadow separator.

## Keyboard navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Enter / Arrow Down | Move to cell below |
| Arrow Up | Move to cell above |
| Alt + Arrow Right | Move to cell on the right |
| Alt + Arrow Left | Move to cell on the left |

This enables fast data entry without using the mouse.

## Undo and redo

The editor maintains a 120-step undo/redo history:

- **Undo**: Revert the last change (column add, row delete, cell edit)
- **Redo**: Reapply an undone change

History is cleared when you reload data from Postgres.

<Note>
Undo/redo works for all structural changes (add/delete rows and columns) and individual cell edits.
</Note>

## Autosave behavior

Changes autosave to Postgres after 850ms of inactivity. The badge shows save status:

- **All changes saved**: Everything is persisted to Postgres
- **Unsaved changes**: Autosave timer is pending
- **Saving...**: Write is in progress

Autosave writes to Postgres **without revalidating the homepage**. To publish changes live, click **Save and Revalidate Homepage**.

## System-managed columns

### Event Key

The Event Key is read-only and managed by the system. It's generated from:

- Title
- Date
- Start Time
- Location
- District/Area

This ensures stable share URLs like `/event/techno-night-2024-03-15-1830-rex-club-2nd`.

<Warning>
Manually editing Event Key is not supported. The field is locked to prevent share URL breakage.
</Warning>

### Featured column (legacy)

The **Featured** column is deprecated. Use the Spotlight & Promoted Scheduler in `/admin/placements` instead.

## Country codes

Host Country and Audience Country support these formats:

- ISO codes: `FR`, `UK`, `CA`, `NL`
- Full names: `France`, `United Kingdom`, `Canada`, `Netherlands`
- Common flags: 🇫🇷, 🇬🇧, 🇨🇦, 🇳🇱

Unknown tokens are flagged during schema validation.

## Display limits

The editor displays 50 rows by default. Click **Show 50 more rows** to load additional batches.

This improves performance for large event sheets while allowing full access to all data.

## Best practices

- **Use consistent formatting** for dates, times, and prices
- **Keep Event Key empty** for new events (auto-generated on save)
- **Freeze the first 2-3 columns** for easier navigation in wide sheets
- **Search before adding** to avoid duplicate events
- **Use custom columns sparingly** to avoid clutter
- **Save and revalidate** after batch edits to publish atomically
