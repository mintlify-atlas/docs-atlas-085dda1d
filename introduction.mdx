## Tech stack

OOOC Fête Finder is built with modern technologies optimized for performance and developer experience:

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 with App Router and React Server Components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with the `postgres` driver
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Base UI (React) with custom components
- **Maps**: MapLibre GL for interactive event maps
- **Integrations**: Google Sheets API, Google Maps Geocoding API, Stripe webhooks
- **Deployment**: Optimized for Vercel with ISR caching

## Architecture highlights

### Data flow

In `DATA_MODE=remote` (production mode), events are read from:

1. **Postgres event store** (primary source) — managed via `/admin/content`
2. **Local CSV fallback** (`data/events.csv`) — used if Postgres is unavailable

Google Sheets is used only for admin backup/preview and import — it's not a live runtime source.

### Caching strategy

The app uses Next.js built-in caching for optimal performance:

- Homepage (`/`): ISR with 5-minute revalidation
- Featured events: 60-second cache on lookups
- Event detail pages: Dynamic rendering
- Admin pages: Always fresh with `force-dynamic`

### Identity and share links

Each event has a stable, immutable **Event Key** (`evt_...`) used in share URLs:

```
/event/<eventKey>/<eventSlug>/
```

The `eventKey` is canonical; the `slug` is decorative for SEO. Share links redirect to the homepage modal state for a seamless browsing experience.
