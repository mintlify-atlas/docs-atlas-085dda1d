title: Analytics and insights
description: Track event engagement, analyze discovery patterns, and export audience segments using the Insights dashboard
---

The Insights dashboard at `/admin/insights` provides comprehensive analytics on event engagement, search behavior, filter usage, and genre preferences. Use these insights to optimize event selection and placement.

## Engagement metrics

The dashboard tracks three primary engagement types:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Views" icon="eye">
    `click` events when users view event details
  </Card>
  <Card title="Outbound Clicks" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square">
    `outbound_click` events when users visit event URLs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Calendar Saves" icon="calendar-plus">
    `calendar_sync` events when users add events to calendars
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
"Saved this" refers to **calendar sync interactions** tracked as aggregate engagement signals, not a user-visible personal saved events list.
</Note>

## Summary metrics

The summary panel shows window-wide aggregates (default: 30 days):

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Click Count | Total detail view interactions |
| Deduped View Count | Unique event views per session |
| Outbound Click Count | Total clicks to external event URLs |
| Calendar Sync Count | Total calendar add actions |
| Unique Session Count | Distinct user sessions with any engagement |
| Unique View Sessions | Sessions with at least one view |
| Unique Outbound Sessions | Sessions with at least one outbound click |
| Unique Calendar Sessions | Sessions with at least one calendar save |
| Outbound Session Rate | % of view sessions that clicked outbound |
| Calendar Session Rate | % of view sessions that saved to calendar |
| Outbound Interaction Rate | % of all clicks that were outbound |
| Calendar Interaction Rate | % of all clicks that were calendar saves |

## Daily time series

The daily series chart visualizes:

- Click count per day
- Outbound click count per day
- Calendar sync count per day

Use this to identify:
- Weekly engagement patterns
- Campaign impact spikes
- Seasonal trends

## Top events table

The top events table ranks up to 60 events by engagement (default view: 30 days):

### Per-event metrics

- **Event Key**: Unique event identifier
- **Event Name**: Display name from event sheet
- **Click Count**: Total views for this event
- **Deduped View Count**: Unique views per session
- **Outbound Click Count**: External URL clicks
- **Calendar Sync Count**: Calendar add actions
- **Unique Session Count**: Sessions that engaged with this event
- **Outbound Session Rate**: % of view sessions that clicked outbound
- **Calendar Session Rate**: % of view sessions that saved to calendar
- **Outbound Interaction Rate**: % of clicks that were outbound
- **Calendar Interaction Rate**: % of clicks that were calendar saves

### Using the table

Sort by different columns to find:
- **Highest click count**: Most viewed events
- **Highest calendar rate**: Events with best save conversion
- **Highest outbound rate**: Events driving the most traffic to partners

<Info>
High outbound and calendar rates indicate strong intent. Use these events for Spotlight placements.

## Discovery analytics

Discovery analytics track how users explore events:

### Summary metrics

- **Search Count**: Total search queries performed
- **Filter Apply Count**: Total filter selections
- **Filter Clear Count**: Total filter removals
- **Unique Session Count**: Sessions that used search or filters

### Top searches

The top searches section shows clustered query patterns:

- **Query**: Normalized search term
- **Count**: Total occurrences
- **Variant Count**: Number of similar queries clustered together
- **Variants**: Specific query variations (e.g., "techno", "Techno ", "TECHNO")

Use this to:
- Identify popular genres or venues
- Discover trending themes
- Optimize event titles and descriptions

### Clustering modes

Search clustering supports two modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Conservative | Stricter matching, fewer clusters |
| Aggressive | More flexible, broader clusters |

Switch modes to balance precision vs. pattern discovery.

### Top filters

The top filters section shows:

- **Filter Group**: Category (genre, arrondissement, price_range, etc.)
- **Filter Value**: Specific selection within the group
- **Count**: Total applications

Supported filter groups:
- `date_range`
- `day_night`
- `arrondissement`
- `genre`
- `nationality`
- `venue_type`
- `venue_setting`
- `oooc_pick`
- `price_range`
- `age_range`

## Genre preferences

The top genres section shows aggregate user preferences:

- **Genre**: Music genre key (e.g., `techno`, `house`, `jazz`)
- **Label**: Human-readable genre name
- **Total Score**: Cumulative preference score across all users
- **Unique Users**: Number of users with this preference

This helps identify the most popular genres in your audience.

## Audience segment export

Export targeted audience lists as CSV based on behavior and preferences.

### Export by discovery filters

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the export form">
    Locate the audience segment export controls in the Insights dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add filter rules">
    Select filter group + value pairs (e.g., `genre=techno`, `arrondissement=3rd`)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set min hits per rule">
    Require users to have used each filter N times (default: 1)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set rule operator">
    - **All**: Users must match ALL rules (AND logic)
    - **Any**: Users must match ANY rule (OR logic)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Export CSV">
    Download the CSV with matching users
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Export by search behavior

Filter users who searched for specific terms:

```text
Search contains: "jazz"
Min hits: 3
```

This exports users who searched for terms containing "jazz" at least 3 times.

### Export by genre preference

Filter users with strong genre preferences:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select genre">
    Choose a genre from the genre preference list
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set min score">
    Require a minimum preference score (default: 2, range: 1-100)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Export CSV">
    Download users with that genre preference
  </Step>
</Steps>

### CSV output format

Exported CSVs include:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| first_name | User first name (if collected) |
| last_name | User last name (if collected) |
| email | User email address |
| source | Collection source (calendar_sync, email_signup, etc.) |
| last_seen_at | Most recent engagement timestamp |
| matched_rules | Number of rules matched |
| total_rule_hits | Sum of hits across all matched rules |
| rule_hit_breakdown | Detailed hit counts per rule |
| match_operator | AND or OR logic used |
| window_start_at | Analysis window start |
| window_end_at | Analysis window end |

## Export limits

To maintain performance:

- **Max window**: 365 days
- **Max hits per rule**: 30
- **Max limit**: 10,000 users per export

Exports are sorted by total rule hits (descending), then email (ascending).

## Adjusting the time window

Change the analysis window in the dashboard controls:

```text
Window: [7 days] [30 days] [90 days] [365 days]
```

All metrics and exports use the selected window.

## Email collection

The Insights dashboard also shows collected email addresses from:

- Calendar sync opt-ins
- Newsletter signups
- Event submission forms

Export all emails or filter by source for targeted campaigns.

## Postgres requirement

<Warning>
Analytics require a configured Postgres connection. If Postgres is unavailable, the dashboard shows:

```text
Postgres not configured
```

Verify Postgres connectivity in `/admin/operations`.
</Warning>

## Best practices

- **Review weekly** to spot emerging trends
- **Compare event performance** to optimize future placements
- **Monitor outbound rates** to ensure partner satisfaction
- **Use genre preferences** to curate genre-specific newsletters
- **Export segments monthly** for email campaigns
- **Track search patterns** to improve event metadata and titles
- **Watch filter usage** to understand user discovery behavior
- **Adjust time window** seasonally to capture relevant patterns
