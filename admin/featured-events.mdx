## Scheduling a featured event

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select placement type">
    Toggle between **Spotlight** and **Promoted** using the mode switcher
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Find the event">
    Search by event name or key in the "Find event" field. The top 2 matches appear as suggestions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select event">
    Click a suggestion to select the event. The selection is confirmed with a badge
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set schedule time">
    Use the **Schedule at** datetime picker to set the start time in Paris timezone
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set duration">
    Enter duration in hours (1-168 hours supported, default: 48 hours)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose activation mode">
    - Click **Feature now** / **Promote now** to start immediately
    - Click **Schedule** to queue for the selected time
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Scheduling multiple Spotlight events when all 3 slots are active queues them. The queue automatically activates entries as slots become available.
</Note>

## Queue states

Each scheduled entry has a state based on timing:

| State | Description | Badge Color |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Active | Currently live on the site | Green (default) |
| Upcoming | Scheduled for future activation | Yellow (secondary) |
| Recent Ended | Ended within the recent window | Gray (outline) |
| Completed | Ended outside the recent window | Gray (outline) |
| Cancelled | Manually cancelled before completion | Red (destructive) |

## Managing scheduled entries

The queue timeline shows all entries with detailed controls.

### Reschedule an entry

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the entry">
    Locate the scheduled entry in the Queue and history table
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Edit start time">
    Modify the datetime-local input in the Actions column
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Reschedule">
    The entry's effective start and end times update automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Cancel an entry

Click the **Cancel** button in the Actions column. The entry's status changes to `cancelled` and it's removed from active or upcoming queue.

<Warning>
Cancelling an **Active** Spotlight entry immediately removes it from the live site. Verify before confirming.
</Warning>

### Clear the queue

Click **Clear Scheduled Queue** to remove all scheduled entries (active, upcoming).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Clear Scheduled Queue">
    Located in the Queue and history header
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm removal">
    If active slots exist, you'll receive two confirmation prompts
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify queue">
    The queue empties and active slots are cleared
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Clear history

Click **Clear History** to remove completed and cancelled entries from the timeline.

This keeps the interface clean without affecting active or upcoming entries.

## Concurrent slot management

### Spotlight slots

Spotlight supports a maximum of 3 concurrent events (configurable):

```text
Active Slots: 2/3
```

When all slots are filled:
- New "Feature now" requests queue as upcoming
- The queue automatically activates entries when slots free up
- Queue position shows placement order (`#1`, `#2`, etc.)

### Promoted slots

Promoted placements have **unlimited concurrent slots**:

```text
Active Slots: 7
```

All "Promote now" requests activate immediately.

## Queue metrics

The dashboard shows real-time queue statistics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Active Slots | Currently live entries (with max limit for Spotlight) |
| Upcoming | Scheduled but not yet active |
| Recent Ended | Completed within the recent window (default: 24 hours) |
| Scheduled | Total active + upcoming entries |

## Timezone handling

All scheduling uses **Europe/Paris** timezone:

- **Requested**: The time you set in the scheduler
- **Effective Start**: Actual activation time (may differ if queued)
- **Effective End**: Calculated as Effective Start + Duration

<Info>
The `datetime-local` input automatically converts to Paris timezone. Your browser's local timezone is handled transparently.
</Info>

## Event selection

The event finder searches across:
- Event name (partial match)
- Event key (exact or partial match)

Up to 50 matches are found, with the top 2 shown as clickable suggestions.

### Selected event badge

When an event is selected, a badge confirms the selection:

```text
[Selected] Techno Night at Rex Club [Clear]
```

Click **Clear** to reset the selection.

## Default duration

Both Spotlight and Promoted use a default duration of **48 hours** (configurable per placement type).

You can override this by setting a custom duration (1-168 hours) before scheduling.

## Paid order fulfillment

Partner promotion requests appear in the **Paid Orders Queue** card (on the same Placements page).

To fulfill a paid order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review the order">
    Check order details, event key, and requested placement type
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use the scheduler">
    Schedule the event using the Spotlight & Promoted Scheduler as normal
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Mark order fulfilled">
    Update the order status in the Paid Orders Queue
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share stats link (optional)">
    Generate a partner stats link if required by the order
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices

- **Schedule during low traffic** for major changes to avoid user confusion
- **Use upcoming slots** to plan multi-day campaigns in advance
- **Monitor active count** to ensure Spotlight slots aren't oversaturated
- **Test duration** with 24-hour slots before committing to longer placements
- **Check queue position** when all Spotlight slots are full
- **Clear history weekly** to keep the timeline readable
- **Use Promoted** for general visibility without slot competition
