Get OOOC Fête Finder up and running on your local machine in just a few minutes. This guide walks you through the essential setup steps to start developing with the app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Node.js" icon="node-js">
    Version 18.x or higher
  </Card>
  <Card title="pnpm" icon="box">
    Version 8.x or higher
  </Card>
  <Card title="PostgreSQL" icon="database">
    Version 14.x or higher
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    Clone the OOOC Fête Finder repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KingPsychopath/oooc-fete-finder.git
    cd oooc-fete-finder
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install all required dependencies using pnpm:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

    This will install Next.js, React, Postgres client, and all other dependencies defined in `package.json`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure environment variables">
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit `.env` and set the required variables:

    ```bash
    # Required - Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
    AUTH_SECRET="your-random-32-plus-character-secret"

    # Required - Your PostgreSQL connection string
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/oooc_fete"

    # Required - Data mode (use "remote" for production-like setup)
    DATA_MODE="remote"

    # Optional but recommended for full admin access
    ADMIN_KEY="your-admin-password"
    ```

    <Note>
      Generate a secure `AUTH_SECRET` using: `openssl rand -base64 32`
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Bootstrap the database">
    Initialize the Postgres event store with sample data:

    ```bash
    pnpm bootstrap:postgres-store
    ```

    This script will:
    - Create the required database tables
    - Seed initial event data from CSV
    - Set up the event store schema
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the development server">
    Run the Next.js development server:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the installation">
    Open your browser and navigate to:
    - **Homepage**: `http://localhost:3000` - View public event listings
    - **Admin**: `http://localhost:3000/admin` - Access admin console (requires `ADMIN_KEY`)

    <Info>
      If you set an `ADMIN_KEY` in your environment, you'll be able to log in to the admin panel and manage events.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify your setup

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Health check">
    Run the health check script to verify all systems are working:

    ```bash
    pnpm health:check
    ```

    You should see output confirming:
    - ✓ Database connection is active
    - ✓ Event store is populated
    - ✓ Admin endpoints are accessible
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Manual verification">
    Check these endpoints manually:

    ```bash
    # Public homepage (should return event data)
    curl http://localhost:3000

    # Admin health check (requires ADMIN_KEY)
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" http://localhost:3000/api/admin/health
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Database check">
    Use the interactive database CLI to inspect your data:

    ```bash
    pnpm db:cli
    ```

    This will show you:
    - Row count and column count
    - Store metadata and settings
    - Data source status
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Optional: Bootstrap featured events

If you want to set up featured event scheduling:

```bash
pnpm bootstrap:featured-schedule
```

This migrates any legacy `Featured` values from CSV rows into the dedicated featured event scheduler queue.

## Development commands

Here are the most common commands you'll use during development:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm dev` | Start development server with hot reload |
| `pnpm build` | Build the production application |
| `pnpm start` | Start production server (after build) |
| `pnpm lint` | Run Biome linter |
| `pnpm lint:fix` | Auto-fix linting issues |
| `pnpm test` | Run Vitest tests |
| `pnpm test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `pnpm db:cli` | Interactive database status CLI |

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Port 3000 is already in use">
  If port 3000 is already in use, you can specify a different port:

  ```bash
  pnpm dev -- -p 3001
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Database connection failed">
  Verify your `DATABASE_URL` is correct and PostgreSQL is running:

  ```bash
  # Check if PostgreSQL is running
  psql -h localhost -U your_user -d oooc_fete -c "SELECT 1;"
  ```

  Common issues:
  - PostgreSQL service not running
  - Incorrect credentials in `DATABASE_URL`
  - Database does not exist (create it first: `createdb oooc_fete`)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="AUTH_SECRET error">
  If you see errors about `AUTH_SECRET`:

  1. Ensure it's set in your `.env` file
  2. Make sure it's at least 32 characters long
  3. Generate a new one: `openssl rand -base64 32`
  4. Restart the dev server after updating `.env`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="DATA_MODE not set">
  If you see "DATA_MODE is required in production":

  ```bash
  # Add to your .env file
  DATA_MODE="remote"
  ```

  Valid values:
  - `remote` - Use Postgres as primary source (recommended)
  - `local` - Use local CSV files only
  - `test` - Use in-memory test data
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Admin access denied">
  If you can't access `/admin`:

  1. Ensure `ADMIN_KEY` is set in `.env`
  2. Clear your browser cookies and try again
  3. Check that you're entering the correct admin password
  4. Restart the dev server after setting `ADMIN_KEY`
</Accordion>
