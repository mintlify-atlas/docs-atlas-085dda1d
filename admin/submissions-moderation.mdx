description: Review, accept, and decline community-submitted events with spam detection and auto-revalidation
---

The Event Submissions system allows event hosts to submit events for inclusion in OOOC Fête Finder. As an admin, you review, accept, or decline submissions with built-in spam detection.

## Submissions overview

The Event Submissions Card in `/admin/content` provides:

- Pending, accepted, and declined submission queues
- Automatic spam signal detection
- One-click accept with auto-revalidation
- Decline with reason tracking
- Open/closed submission toggle
- Metrics for last 7 days

## Submission status tabs

Submissions are organized by status:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Pending" icon="clock">
    Awaiting admin review and decision
  </Card>
  <Card title="Accepted" icon="check">
    Approved and added to the live event sheet
  </Card>
  <Card title="Declined" icon="xmark">
    Rejected with a recorded reason
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Reviewing a submission

Each submission displays:

### Primary fields

- **Event Name**: Title of the event
- **Date and Time**: Event date, start time, and optional end time
- **Location**: Venue or location name
- **Host Email**: Submitter's contact email
- **Proof Link**: URL provided to verify event authenticity

### Optional fields

Expand the "Optional details" section to view:

- End time
- Genre
- Price
- Age restrictions
- Indoor/Outdoor venue type
- Arrondissement
- Additional notes from the host

### Spam signals

Spam detection flags suspicious submissions with badges:

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| honeypot_filled | Hidden field was filled (bot detection) |
| completed_too_fast | Form completed in under 3 seconds |

Submissions with spam signals should be reviewed carefully before accepting.

<Warning>
Spam signals are **indicators**, not automatic rejections. Legitimate submissions can occasionally trigger these flags. Always review the proof link and event details.
</Warning>

## Accepting a submission

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify event details">
    Check the event name, date, location, and proof link for legitimacy
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review spam signals">
    Confirm the submission doesn't have suspicious spam flags
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Accept">
    The event is immediately added to the event sheet in Postgres
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic revalidation">
    The homepage revalidates automatically, making the event live within seconds
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Accepting a submission creates a new row in the Event Sheet Editor with the submitted data and generates an Event Key automatically.
</Note>

## Declining a submission

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select decline reason">
    Choose a reason from the dropdown:
    - Not enough information
    - Duplicate submission
    - Event not relevant
    - Unable to verify
    - Spam signal
    - Other (requires custom reason)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add custom reason (if Other)">
    Type a specific reason in the text field that appears
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Decline">
    The submission moves to the Declined tab with the reason recorded
  </Step>
</Steps>

Decline reasons are stored with the submission for future reference.

## Decline reason options

| Reason | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| Not enough information | Missing critical details (date, location, proof link) |
| Duplicate submission | Event already in the sheet or previously submitted |
| Event not relevant | Outside OOOC's coverage area or genre focus |
| Unable to verify | Proof link broken or event cannot be confirmed |
| Spam signal | Triggered spam detection flags and looks suspicious |
| Other | Custom reason (requires text input) |

## Submission metrics

The metrics grid shows:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Pending | Current submissions awaiting review |
| Accepted (7d) | Approvals in the last 7 days |
| Declined (7d) | Rejections in the last 7 days |
| Total | All-time submission count |

## Opening and closing submissions

Toggle the submission endpoint using the **Open/Closed** switch:

- **Open**: The public submit form is accessible at `/submit`
- **Closed**: The submit endpoint is blocked, returning an error

Use this to:
- Prevent submissions during high-volume periods
- Close submissions for seasonal breaks
- Temporarily disable while handling a backlog

<Info>
Closing submissions displays a warning banner to admins and blocks the `/api/events/submit` endpoint completely.
</Info>

## Submission data fields

### Required fields

- Event name
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Start time (HH:MM format)
- Location
- Host email
- Proof link

### Optional fields

- End time
- Genre
- Price (free text)
- Age restrictions
- Indoor/Outdoor
- Arrondissement
- Notes (free text, max 500 characters)

## Anti-spam measures

The submission form includes:

### Honeypot field

A hidden field that humans shouldn't fill. Bots often fill all fields, triggering this signal.

### Timing check

Submissions completed in under 3 seconds are flagged as `completed_too_fast`. Legitimate users typically take 10+ seconds.

### Fingerprinting

Each submission records:
- Source IP hash
- Email IP hash
- Browser fingerprint hash

This helps identify repeat spam attempts from the same source.

## Reviewed submission history

Accepted and declined submissions show:

- **Reviewed At**: Timestamp of admin decision
- **Reviewed By**: Admin user who made the decision
- **Review Reason**: Decline reason (for declined submissions)
- **Accepted Event Key**: The generated Event Key (for accepted submissions)

## Submission settings storage

The Open/Closed setting is stored in:

```text
Store path: /var/data/event-submissions-settings.json
```

The settings status card shows:
- Provider (file / memory / postgres)
- Location path
- Last updated timestamp and admin user

## Best practices

- **Review pending submissions daily** to provide timely responses to hosts
- **Verify proof links** by opening them in a new tab before accepting
- **Check for duplicates** by searching the event sheet for similar events
- **Use clear decline reasons** to help hosts improve future submissions
- **Monitor spam signals** but don't auto-reject based on flags alone
- **Close submissions temporarily** during event sheet overhauls or migrations
- **Respond to hosts** directly via email if a submission needs clarification
